## Muscle Sensor LED Display
This micro-controller project detects muscle contractions and displays it on to a 32x32 LED screen. The harder you contract your muscle, the larger the wave! Any large enough muscle is compatible, such as the biceps, forearms, or even forehead muscles!

## Motivation
The MyoWare Muscle Sensor. 
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.
 
## Materials
The schematic and board files were designed for the Atmega164p and the SPX-14633 32x32 LED screen. Another microcontroller can be used, and this schematic should make a good reference. Because of the fast clock and refresh rate needed to drive the 32x32 LED screen, I would  recommend using a micro controller with a 1 MHz processor and higher. An optional RS-232 serial interface is included for debugging and JTAG interface for on-board programming of the Atmega 164P.

## Code
The algorithm C code does not use any libraries, besides avr/io. Using adafruit's libraries, the slowest processor that can adequately run the 32x32 matrix is 16MHz ([32x32 LED Matrix](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/14633)). By avoiding the libraries and driving each pin directly, the LED matrix can be adequately driven on a 1 MHz processor (atmega164p).
